About Our Guides:

Lior Tsarfaty is an international touring musician, recording artist, and the musical director of ‚ÄúChochmat Ha‚ÄôLev,‚Äù a Jewish renewal spiritual center. Lior has always viewed music as more than entertainment. For Lior, it‚Äôs also been a profound source of healing. So when he left his native Israel in 2009 to study in California, it was to deepen his understanding of music as a vehicle for transformation.
As a student at the California Institute of Integral Studies, Lior enrolled in the Voice, Sound and Healing Music Program. He also explored the field of body-oriented psychotherapy, attending the Hakomi Institute of California. Lior broadened his scope by working with a wide range of spiritual organizations, teachers, and artists, including Patti Cathcart (Tuck and Patty), Roshi Norman Fisher, Joanna Macy, Starhawk, and Jennifer Berezan.

Lior set about employing music as a tool for peacemaking and, in 2014, released his debut album ‚ÄúLior Tsarfaty & The Prayer Songs Project,‚Äù which brought together Israeli, Moroccan, Indian, Canadian, and American musicians in perfect harmony. His second album, ‚ÄúI Am You,‚Äù is a collaboration between 35 Israeli and Palestinian musicians. His most recent album ‚ÄúIn My Ancestors‚Äô Arms‚Äù is a tribute to his Jewish heritage.

Over the years, Lior has used the healing power of music to make a difference for the homeless, children, hospice patients, and elders. Lior developed a unique and successful method of working musically with Alzheimer's patients. His groundbreaking work is featured in the film "There is a Place."

Rabbi Zac Kamenetz is a rabbi and community leader based in Berkeley, CA.  As the founder and CEO of Shefa, Zac is leading a movement to integrate safe and supported psychedelic use into the Jewish spiritual tradition, advocating for the healing of individual and inherited traumas, and inspiring a Jewish religious and creative renaissance in the 21st century. He is a qualified instructor of MBSR and is trained in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapeutic care through Inbodied Life and the Hakomi Institute of Northern California.

<div class="event_deets"><h3>Shefa Breathwork Ceremony</h3>
<p>Tuesday April 15 2025 6:00 PM until 9:00 PM</p>
<button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleDescription(this)">Show Details</button>
<div class="event_description"><p>Join us for a breathwork experience rooted in Jewish wisdom and tradition, offering a space to explore expanded states of consciousness through breath.
We will be practicing a simple yet powerful breathwork technique inspired by Holotropic Breathwork, infused with Jewish spiritual frameworks to help support the inner movement of the Passover season--from narrowness to expansion, from despair to joy. This practice has the potential to evoke altered or ecstatic states, similar to those described in Jewish mystical traditions.

Our evening will begin with an introduction to the practice, exploring its connection to Jewish mysticism, sacred breath (neshima), and soul (neshama). We will review the breathwork process and what to expect. We will set intentions and ground into Jewish sacred time.

The breathwork session itself will last about an hour and a half.  We will conclude with group sharing and integration, tapping into the power of communal reflection to ground our experience.

This is an opportunity to connect with yourself, your breath, and the divine in a safe and sacred container. This gathering is rooted in Jewish tradition and welcomes everyone with an open heart.
The Circle will take place on Tuesday, April 15th from 6:00-9:00pm at 3049 Adeline St, Berkeley, CA 94703

Cost: $150

<p>About Our Guides:</p>

<p>Lior Tsarfaty is an international touring musician, recording artist, and the musical director of ‚ÄúChochmat Ha‚ÄôLev,‚Äù a Jewish renewal spiritual center. Lior has always viewed music as more than entertainment. For Lior, it‚Äôs also been a profound source of healing. So when he left his native Israel in 2009 to study in California, it was to deepen his understanding of music as a vehicle for transformation.
As a student at the California Institute of Integral Studies, Lior enrolled in the Voice, Sound and Healing Music Program. He also explored the field of body-oriented psychotherapy, attending the Hakomi Institute of California. Lior broadened his scope by working with a wide range of spiritual organizations, teachers, and artists, including Patti Cathcart (Tuck and Patty), Roshi Norman Fisher, Joanna Macy, Starhawk, and Jennifer Berezan.</p>

<p>Lior set about employing music as a tool for peacemaking and, in 2014, released his debut album ‚ÄúLior Tsarfaty & The Prayer Songs Project,‚Äù which brought together Israeli, Moroccan, Indian, Canadian, and American musicians in perfect harmony. His second album, ‚ÄúI Am You,‚Äù is a collaboration between 35 Israeli and Palestinian musicians. His most recent album ‚ÄúIn My Ancestors‚Äô Arms‚Äù is a tribute to his Jewish heritage.</p>

<p>Over the years, Lior has used the healing power of music to make a difference for the homeless, children, hospice patients, and elders. Lior developed a unique and successful method of working musically with Alzheimer's patients. His groundbreaking work is featured in the film "There is a Place."

<div class="event_deets"><h3>Record Release: SONGS WE NO LONGER SING by phipps pt.</h3>
<p>Wednesday October 8 2025 7:00 PM until 10:00 PM</p>
<button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleDescription(this)">Show Details</button>
<div class="event_description"><p>Record Release Party for Songs We No Longer Sing. Here's a writeup by Matt Sussman:</p>

<p>Phipps Pt.'s second studio album ‚Äì is a stunning song cycle which moves across vignettes of consumption, lust, grief, and what it takes to push through life at a moment when so many forces are marshaled against living.</p>

<p>Sharrock‚Äôs gossamer vocals and delicately finger-picked guitar patterns find their complement in Leidecker‚Äôs equally sensitive approach to processing both, so that input frequently becomes indistinguishable from output. The album‚Äôs electronic glitches, buzzes, whirrs, and drones burnish rather than obscure Sharrock‚Äôs plaintive melodies and imagistic lyrics. Like practiced quilters, Phipps Pt. tenderly work their sonic material into a final composition whose design, no matter how abstract, never erases the traces of the human hands behind it.</p>

<p>Sharrock often says at the start of a performance that Phipps Pt. is, ‚Äúan idea and a place that we are going to together.‚Äù As with Ren√© Daumal‚Äôs Mount Analogue, Phipps Pt. is not a terminus but an occasion for the journey. Full of strange beauty and unexpected emotional candor, Songs We No Longer Sing issues a similarly generous invitation but with the added luxury that the listener is now able to partake of many return visits.</p></div><a href="https://phippspt.bandcamp.com/album/songs-we-no-longer-sing">Event Link</a></div>
