<div class="event_deets"><h3>Singing the Great Turning 8</h3>
<p>Monday May 5 2025 6:00 PM until 9:00 PM</p>
<button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleDescription(this)">Show Details</button>
<div class="event_description"><p>Join us for this 9-week in-person singing journey around the spiral of Joanna Macy's "The Work That Reconnects" with Jess Serrante of 'We Are The Great Turning' Podcast and Lauren Arrow, Songtender + Music Leader.

In these times of division and distraction, it’s more important than ever that we come together in community and cultivate practices that build resilience in the face of despair. By weaving song and The Work That Reconnects, our aim is to help nourish community and help us remember the work we are here to do.

Each week we will use the foundations taught in the “We Are The Great Turning” podcast, which brings listeners to the kitchen table of legendary eco-spiritual teacher, and Berkeley local, Joanna Macy, interviewed by Jess Serrante. Each episode dives into what it takes to live with our hearts and integrity intact in this time of global crisis and helps us to explore abiding wisdom that can help us stay joyful and energized as we work toward a more just and life-sustaining world. ​</p></div><a href="https://www.processsing.com/greatturning">Event Link</a></div>
